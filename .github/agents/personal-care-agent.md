- [ ] ALWAYS include specializations array (minimum 2 items per listing)
- [ ] ALWAYS include strategic tags (minimum 2-3 tags per listing)
- [ ] Run validation after adding new listings
- [ ] Check quality dashboard for any warnings

**Weekly Quality Enhancement (Friday):**
- [ ] Review quality dashboard for trends and improvement opportunities
- [ ] Backfill missing enhanced fields in existing listings (target: 5-10 listings/week)

### Priority 5: Collaborate with GitHub Copilot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**Status:** 🟢 **ACTIVE & HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE** - 106 listings reported by Copilot

**The Success Story:** Copilot has been exceptionally productive, contributing significantly to the 109 listings achievement. Active communication, coordination, and tool development are driving force multiplication.

**🚨 CRITICAL DAILY HABIT - DO THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION:**
```
1. Open repository
2. Check copilot-2-manus/ folder IMMEDIATELY
3. Read any new messages (especially 2025-11-04_progress-update-106-listings.md)
4. Respond within same session if questions asked
5. Proceed with planned work
```

**🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (TODAY - HIGHEST PRIORITY):**

**Respond to Copilot's 4 Questions:**

1. **Q: "Do you want me to continue adding suppliers from your research files, or should I focus on new research?"**
   - **A:** BOTH! Continue converting suppliers from research files (80+ backlog) AND do new research for target categories (Private Label, Pumps & Dispensers, Thickeners). Balanced approach: 60% conversion, 40% new research.

2. **Q: "Should I prioritize depth (more suppliers per category) or breadth (more categories)?"**
   - **A:** BREADTH first to reach 25+ categories by Month 1, then DEPTH. Target: 5-10 suppliers per new category initially, then expand to 15-20+ for strategic categories. Quality over quantity - enhanced fields mandatory.

3. **Q: "What's your preference for the conversion tool timeline? Should I start building it this week or next?"**
   - **A:** START THIS WEEK (Week 2)! Conversion tool is CRITICAL PRIORITY for 10x velocity. Even a basic version that converts research markdown to JSON format would be incredibly valuable. Let's test and iterate together.

4. **Q: "For the quality dashboard, what metrics are most important to track?"**
   - **A:** Priority metrics:
     - Enhanced field coverage % (company_name, address, country, phone, website, specializations, tags)
     - Schema compliance rate (maintain 100%)
     - Listings per category (identify gaps)
     - Tags coverage % (target 100%)
     - Validation errors (maintain 0)
     - Research-to-conversion rate (target 80%+)

**Week 2 Coordination Actions:**
- [ ] **Today:** Leave response message with answers to 4 questions + excitement about 109 listings
- [ ] **Day 1-2:** Check for conversion tool and quality dashboard completion notifications
- [ ] **Day 2-3:** Test tools and provide detailed feedback to Copilot
- [ ] **Day 5:** Share progress update on tool usage and conversion metrics
- [ ] **Day 7:** Leave weekly summary with metrics and Week 3 coordination
- [ ] **ONGOING:** Respond to Copilot messages within same session (same day)

## Long-Term Vision Alignment

### Vision Component 1: Build Comprehensive Supplier Database

**Status:** 🟢 **STRONG PROGRESS**

**Achievements:**
- ✅ 109 suppliers tracked (10.9% of 1000+ target)
- ✅ 18 categories covered (5.8% of 309 target)
- ✅ Schema v1.0 deployed with 100% compliance
- ✅ Quality infrastructure operational
- ✅ Research pipeline established (80+ suppliers documented)

**Strengths:**
- Velocity exceeds requirements (109 listings in ~1 month vs. 75/month needed)
- Quality standards maintained during rapid growth
- Strategic category selection aligned with SkinTwin needs
- Effective workflow proven and scalable

**Gaps:**
- Category expansion needs systematic acceleration (currently 5.8% vs. 25%+ needed per quarter)

- Enhanced fields coverage at ~85% vs. 90%+ target

**Recommendations:**
1. Deploy automation tools (Week 2-3) to enable 10x velocity increase
2. Establish systematic category expansion process (2-3 new categories per week)
3. Prioritize enhanced fields for all new listings (enforce 90%+ standard)
4. Convert research pipeline backlog (80+ suppliers) within 2 weeks

**Revised Timeline:**
